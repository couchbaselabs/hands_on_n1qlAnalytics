## Just like SQL

Moving on to queries, the good news is that many SQL++ queries will look quite familiar to
you. For example, consider this simple query, which will get the names of all customers that have a rating that is greater than 650.

<pre id="example">
SELECT name
FROM customers
WHERE rating > 650;
</pre>
