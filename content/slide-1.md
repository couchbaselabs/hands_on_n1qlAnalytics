## Introduction

Welcome to Querying JSON with SQL++!

If you know something about SQL and want to leverage that knowledge to
gain a working knowledge of SQL++ (using the *N1QL for Analytics*
implementation) this tutorial is for you. We’ll assume that you are
familiar with the basic SELECT-FROM-WHERE structure of an SQL query.
We'll also assume that you know a little bit about joins and grouping,
as defined in the SQL Standard and supported in all SQL
implementations.
We won’t expect any knowledge of advanced or complex SQL features.

Each lesson will populate the Query box with a query that you can either
simply execute or that you can modify to try out more.

Happy querying!
