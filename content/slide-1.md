## Introduction

Welcome to Querying JSON with SQL++!

If you know something about SQL and want to leverage that knowledge to
gain a working knowledge of SQL++ (using the *N1QL for Analytics*
implementation) this tutorial is for you. We’ll assume that you are
familiar with the basic SELECT-FROM-WHERE structure of an SQL query.
We'll also assume that you know a little bit about joins and grouping,
as defined in the SQL Standard and supported in all SQL
implementations.
We won’t expect any knowledge of advanced or complex SQL features.
