## Just like SQL (4)

Grouping and aggregation works also as expected.

In this example we retrieve the number of orders for the last 3 days that had
at least one order.

<pre id="example">
SELECT order_date, count(*) AS cnt
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date
HAVING count(*) > 0
ORDER BY order_date DESC
LIMIT 3;
</pre>
